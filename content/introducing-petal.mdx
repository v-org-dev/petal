We're excited to introduce **Petal**, the next generation of AI customer support designed specifically for e-commerce businesses. 🌸

## The Problem We're Solving

E-commerce businesses today face several critical challenges in customer support:

- Manual knowledge base updates that fall behind customer inquiries
- Generic AI responses that don't understand your specific products or policies
- Text-only support that requires customers to navigate multiple steps manually
- Disconnected support channels that don't share learnings

Petal addresses these pain points head-on with three breakthrough technologies.

## Our Innovation

### 1. Self-Evolving Knowledge Base

Unlike traditional chatbots that require constant manual updates, Petal analyzes every conversation daily to:

- Detect gaps in your knowledge base
- Identify outdated information
- Spot emerging customer trends
- Generate suggested FAQ updates

You simply approve the changes in minutes—not hours of manual work.

### 2. RAG-Powered Accuracy

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) ensures Petal **never hallucinates**. Every answer:

- Comes from your actual knowledge base
- Cites its source
- Stays accurate and trustworthy
- Can be easily verified and improved

### 3. A2UI Guided Replies

Petal doesn't just send text—it embeds interactive buttons and guided flows directly in the conversation:

- **Track Order** button pulls real-time shipping info
- **Start Return** flow guides customers through the process
- **Product Recommendations** with clickable options
- **Checkout Links** for quick purchases

## Why Petal Stands Out

> "Petal reduced our support tickets by 55% in the first month. The self-evolving knowledge base means we're always getting smarter." - Sarah Chen, Head of Support at BloomBox

Here's how we compare to traditional solutions:

| Feature                      | Petal | Zendesk | Gorgias |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| Self-Evolving Knowledge Base | ✅     | ❌       | ❌       |
| RAG-Powered Accuracy         | ✅     | ❌       | ❌       |
| A2UI Interactive Flows       | ✅     | ❌       | ❌       |
| No Per-Seat Pricing          | ✅     | ❌       | ❌       |

## Real-World Impact

Our early customers are seeing remarkable results:

- **40-60% reduction** in support ticket volume
- **3x faster** resolution times for automated inquiries
- **92% customer satisfaction** rating
- **15+ hours saved** per week on knowledge base maintenance

## Getting Started with Petal

Launching Petal is seamless:

1. **Connect your data sources** - Shopify, WooCommerce, or custom API
2. **Import existing FAQs** - We'll enhance them automatically
3. **Deploy across channels** - Web, email, WhatsApp, Messenger
4. **Watch it learn** - Daily suggested improvements delivered to your inbox

## What's Next?
